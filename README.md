2048-Game
=========

2048 is a fun tile matching mathematical game.

Rules
=====
Match 2 adjacent tiles with the same value to form a number twice as large. Limit the number of tiles on your screen, because all 16 tiles on a screen will likely mean a loss. If you can no longer combine two adjacent identical numbers, the game will end. If you manage to reveal the final 16384 tile, you win.

Scoring
=====
* 1st tile - 2
* 2nd tile - 4
* 3rd tile - 8
* 4th tile - 16
* 5th tile - 32
* 6th tile - 64
* 7th tile - 128
* 8th tile - 256
* 9th tile - 512
* 10th tile - 1024
* 11th tile - 2048
* 12th title - 4096
* 13th tile - 8192
* Final Tile - 16384

Your total score is the sum of the values of the tiles on the board.

Example
2  8  2  4
4  2  16 2
-  -  -  4
-  -  -  2

The sum of the numbers on the screen is 46, so your score will be 46.
